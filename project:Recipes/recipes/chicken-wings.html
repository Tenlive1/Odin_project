    <h2>Descriptions</h2>
    <p>These glazed honey sriracha wings are quite delicious and incredibly simple, but the sauce is merely an afterthought here. The real star of the show is the strange, but effective technique of coating the wings with a baking powder-laced spice rub before baking. Through the magic of chemical reactions, the surface of the chicken becomes bone-dry, and eventually crisps up to something very similar to what would come out of a deep fryer.</p>
